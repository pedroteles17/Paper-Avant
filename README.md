### Comentary about the xlsx package

The xlsx package loads the rJava package. This package requires Java to be installed in the local machine. If you don't have Java installed, follow the [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37735108/r-error-onload-failed-in-loadnamespace-for-rjava) tutorial. A good answer is offered by stevec in Dec 20, 2021 (this can change).
