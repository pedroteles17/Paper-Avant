### Comentary about the xlsx package

The xlsx package loads the rJava package. This package requires Java to be installed in the local machine. If you don't have Java installed, follow the [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37735108/r-error-onload-failed-in-loadnamespace-for-rjava) tutorial. A good answer is offered by stevec in Dec 20, 2021 (this can change).

# Instructions

First, make sure that you have both R and Java installed.

Then, the code should be run in the folowing order:

1- 00_setup.R: install and load all dependencies (latest version);

2- 01_clean_data.R: create folder 'brazil' containing the cleaned data;

3- 02_backtests.R: create folder 'portfolios' containing the portfolios returns that will be used to generate the figures and tables;

4- 03_main_code.R: create a 'graphs_tables.xlsx' file containing all the tables and figures used in the article.

No further action is needed on the replicator's part.

Following the procedure described above generates an Excel file that contains all the figures and tables used in the article ('graphs_tables.xlsx'). Each table and figure is stored in a separate tab. The name of each tab indicates wheter it refers to a figure ("F") or a table ("T") and the number of the figure or table. In this case, "T3" means "Table 3" and "F2" means "Figure 2", for example.

If the replicator can't access the Excel file, he can, nonetheless, access all the figures and tables using R through the variables that store this data. The name of each variable indicates if it refers to a figure ("fig") or a table ("tb") and the number of the figure or table. If it's a table, it also indicates which panel ("panel_"). In this case, "tb5_panel_d" means "Table 5 - Panel D" and "fig1" means "Figure 1", for example.
